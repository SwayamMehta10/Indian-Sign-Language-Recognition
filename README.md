# Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition
This is an AI-based project for Indian Sign Language Recognition. We created a detection model using Convoluted Neural Networks that was able to achieve 98% accuracy which is quite good compared to other studies that have been done previously in this domain. 

### Custom Database
We have also developed an easy way for creating a custom database of ISL hand gestures which can be contributed back to the open-source community and used in future projects. 

In order to capture the images, just press the key corresponding to the hand sign on the keyboard. For example, to capture the hand signs of the letter 'a', simply press 'A' on your keyboard.

***Note:*** Make sure the background is clear from distractions and the hands are clearly visible.

The interface for capturing hand gestures also shows the real-time count for each letter that have been captured and stored in the database.

The captured images will be stored in the ***/dataset/train*** folder.
